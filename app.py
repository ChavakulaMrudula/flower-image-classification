st.markdown("""
Flower classification involves identifying the species or category of a flower from an image.
This task is complex due to the vast diversity of flower species, varying environmental conditions,
and different angles from which photos can be taken. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular
choice for this task due to their ability to automatically learn features from images.
